### Personal Code Challenge
I have given myself the challenge to do this project without using **ANY** else or elif keywords. I have found this
resulted in more readable code as it has forced me to use functions and objects where an *else* could've been used 
instead. Would I recommend taking this challenge with one of your projects? Absolutely, it forces you to think a bit
further with how you write code, if something needs to be a function, object, or just a few if statements.
